# Gemini Deep Research Prompt: Pricing Strategy for "Kloqo" in Kerala

**Context:**
We have validated the product-market fit for "Kloqo" (a live queue management system) in the Kerala private healthcare market.
**Key Value Validation:** The system can potentially restore **₹50,000+ per month** in lost revenue for a clinic by minimizing "No-Shows" and maximizing doctor throughput using a "zipper algorithm" for walk-ins.
**Target Audience:** Private Specialist Clinics and Polyclinics in Kerala (Tier 1/2/3 cities).

**Research Objective:**
Develop a data-backed **Pricing Strategy** and **Business Model** that maximizes adoption while capturing a fair share of the value created. I need to know what to charge, how to charge it, and how to bundle it.

**Please answer the following questions with data/insights specific to the Indian/Kerala SaaS market:**

### 1. Competitor Pricing Benchmarking (The "Anchor")
*   What is the current "street price" (not just website list price) for comparable clinic management software in India?
    *   **National Players:** Practo Ray, Lybrate, DocPulse.
    *   **Local/Legacy Players:** Offline desktop ERP software commonly used in Kerala pharmacies/clinics.
*   Do these competitors charge a flat fee, a per-doctor fee, or a per-appointment commission?
*   Are there hidden costs (e.g., "Setup Fee," "Training Fee," "SMS Credits") that are standard in the industry?

### 2. Willingness to Pay (WTP) in Tier 2/3 Cities
*   For a single-doctor specialist clinic in a city like Thrissur or Kottayam, what is the psychological price ceiling for a monthly software subscription? (e.g., Is ₹1,000/month "cheap" but ₹3,000/month "expensive"?)
*   Does the WTP change significantly if hardware is included (e.g., a tablet for the receptionist)?

### 3. Monetization Models: Who Pays?
*   **Model A (SaaS):** Clinic pays a monthly subscription. (Standard B2B).
*   **Model B (Patient Pay):** Clinic pays nothing (or low fee), but patients pay a small "Convenience Fee" (e.g., ₹10-₹20) to book online or track live status.
    *   *Research Question:* Is the "Convenience Fee" model culturally acceptable in Kerala healthcare, or will it cause backlash? (Compare with BookMyShow or IRCTC service charges).
*   **Model C (Hybrid):** Low SaaS fee + SMS/WhatsApp usage charges.

### 4. Structuring the Offer (The "Hook")
*   Based on Indian B2B psychology, which structure works better:
    *   **Monthly Subscription** (Low barrier to entry).
    *   **Annual Upfront** (Deep discount, better cash flow).
    *   **Lifetime License** (Common request from older doctors accustomed to buying desktop software once).
*   What is a compelling "Free Trial" duration? (7 days vs 14 days vs "First 100 Appts Free").

### 5. Sales Channel Costs
*   If I hire local sales agents (medical representatives) in Kerala to sell this, what is the standard commission rate or incentive structure?

**Output Desired:**
*   **A Recommended Pricing Tier Structure** (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise) with suggested INR price points.
*   **A "Cost-Benefit" Argument** I can present to a doctor (e.g., "This app costs ₹X/day, which is less than the price of one consultation").
*   A recommendation on **Patient-Side Fees** (Yes/No/Risky).
